# CSES
Java solutions to CSES Problem Set

## Graph-Section
 <ins>Building Teams</ins> - Find connected components in the graph.

 <ins>Labyrinth</ins> - BFS can be used to find the shortest path. Use 2 queues for, one for rows and one
   for columns for easy implementation.

 <ins>Building Roads</ins> - Given n cities with m roads. If we could find out the isolated parts (clusters)
   of the graph, call it x. Then we need x-1 roads. Select two cities from two components to create a road between them. 
   

 <ins>Message Route</ins> - Use BFS for the shortest path. Parent array can be used to trace the path.

 <ins>Building Teams</ins> - Graph colouring. See if a bipartite graph can be made. 

 <ins>Round Trip</ins> - Detecting a cycle with more than 2 nodes. Use DFS with parent array to trace
   the path.
